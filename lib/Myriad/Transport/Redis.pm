=pod

We expect to expose:

- stream handling functionality, including claiming/pending
- get/set and observables
- sorted sets
- hyperloglog existence
- simple queues via lists
- pub/sub

This module is responsible for namespacing, connection handling and clustering.
It should also cover retry for stateless calls.

Time to wait for items, in milliseconds.

Number of items to allow per batch (pending / readgroup calls).

Given two IDs, compare them as if doing a C<< <=> >> numeric
comparison.

=head2 next_id

Given a stream ID, returns the next ID after it.
This is managed by the simple expedient of incrementing
the right-hand part of the identifier.

=head2 pending

Check for any pending items, claiming them for reprocessing as required.

Takes the following named parameters:

=item * C<stream> - the stream name

=item * C<group> - which consumer group to check

=item * C<client> - the name of the client to check

=back

Returns a L<Ryu::Source> for the pending items in this stream.
